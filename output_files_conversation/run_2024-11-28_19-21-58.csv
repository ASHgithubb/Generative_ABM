6. **Plastic raincoat (large size)** - Protection from the sun and potential rain, which can be rare but dangerous in desert climates.
7. **Torch with 4 battery-cells** - Important for visibility at night; also useful for signaling.
8. **Sunglasses (for everyone)** - Protecting our eyes from the harsh sun is important to maintain visibility and comfort.
9. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets** - Replenishing salt can help prevent dehydration when water is scarce.
10. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'** - Useful for foraging and food identification if we run out of supplies.
11. **Overcoat (for everyone)** - Although it’s hot now, temperatures can drop at night.
12. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor** - Can be used for sanitation or as a signal, but not as useful as other items.
13. **Parachute (red & white)** - Could be used for signaling, but not immediately critical.
14. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)** - While it might offer protection, its utility in this environment is not as high compared to others.
15. **A cosmetic mirror** - Limited use apart from signaling; less critical compared to survival needs.

What do you all think? I’m open to hearing your thoughts and adjustments!"
