"(Turn 6) Taylor has responded: Taylor here! I really appreciate the spirit of collaboration we've built as we work through our rankings. Morgan, your summary aligns well with my thoughts, and I think we're very close to finalizing our list.

I agree with your assessment of the overcoat and raincoat. Since we are in the Atacama Desert, where rain is rare, the plastic raincoat's primary function would be to provide sun protection. However, keeping warm at night with the overcoat is also essential due to the temperature drops. 

So, we might consider switching their positions depending on how we prioritize immediate needs. If we're focused on day-time survival and protection from the sun, the raincoat might deserve a higher rank. Conversely, if we think about the cold nights, the overcoat could take precedence.

Here's a potential adjustment based on that discussion:

- Keep the **Overcoat (for everyone)** at **9th**, as protection from the cold is crucial for our immediate survival.
- Move the **Plastic raincoat (large size)** to **10th** for sun protection.

With those adjustments, our ranking would look like this:

1. **2 litres of water per person**
2. **First-aid kit**
3. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'**
4. **Torch with 4 battery-cells**
5. **Air map of the area**
6. **Magnetic compass**
7. **Folding knife**
8. **Sunglasses (for everyone)**
9. **Overcoat (for everyone)**
10. **Plastic raincoat (large size)**
11. **Parachute (red & white)**
12. **A cosmetic mirror**
13. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)**
14. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor**
15. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets**

How does this updated ranking resonate with both of you? Let’s finalize it!"
