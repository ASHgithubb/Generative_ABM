Starting interactive task:
"(Turn 1) Alex has responded: Given the dire circumstances we're in, survival is our top priority. To ensure we make the best decisions, I would like to propose we focus first on the items most essential for immediate survival—hydration, shelter, navigation, and safety.

1. **2 litres of water per person** - This is our most critical need in the desert climate to prevent dehydration.
2. **First-aid kit** - Injuries can happen, so having medical supplies is vital.
3. **Torch with 4 battery-cells** - If we need to travel or signal for help at night, this will be invaluable.
4. **Air map of the area** - Understanding our surroundings is crucial for navigation and finding potential routes to safety.
5. **Magnetic compass** - This will help us orient ourselves and navigate, especially in a vast desert with few landmarks.
6. **Sunglasses (for everyone)** - Protecting our eyes from the harsh sun is essential for visibility and comfort.
7. **Plastic raincoat (large size)** - While it might not rain, it can serve as protection against the sun or wind.
8. **Folding knife** - This is useful for various tasks, from food preparation to building shelter.
9. **Overcoat (for everyone)** - Provides warmth during potential cold nights.
10. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'** - This could be helpful if we run out of rations and need food sources.
11. **Cosmetic mirror** - Could be used for signaling or starting a fire with sunlight.
12. **Parachute (red & white)** - While it may not provide direct survival aid, it could be used for shade or as a signaling device.
13. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)** - Useful for defense, but we should consider its necessity versus potential risks.
14. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets** - While important for hydration and electrolyte balance, it's less critical than immediate water.
15. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor** - This could be somewhat useful for sanitization or as a signal, but in a survival scenario, it’s the least critical item.

I believe this order reflects our immediate survival needs and potential rescue strategies. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this ranking!"
