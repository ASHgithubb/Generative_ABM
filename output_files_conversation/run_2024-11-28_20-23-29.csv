Starting interactive task:
"(Turn 1) Alex has responded: Alright team, let's get started on ranking these items. As someone who values logic and practicality, I believe we should focus on what will ensure our immediate survival, particularly in such extreme conditions.

To begin, I think the most critical items should be those that provide hydration and protection from the harsh environment. Here’s my initial thought on how we might prioritize:

1. **2 litres of water per person** - Hydration is vital, especially in such high temperatures.
2. **First-aid kit** - In case of injuries, this is essential for treating wounds or ailments.
3. **Plastic raincoat (large size)** - This could provide some protection from the sun and help retain body moisture.
4. **Torch with 4 battery-cells** - A source of light could be invaluable if we need to navigate at night or signal for help.
5. **Magnetic compass** - This will help us find our way and navigate towards potential rescue areas.
6. **Air map of the area** - A map will provide a broader context of where we are and possible routes to safety.
7. **Sunglasses (for everyone)** - Protecting our eyes from the intense sun is important to avoid damage and maintain visibility.
8. **Folding knife** - A versatile tool that can aid in various tasks, from cutting to food preparation.
9. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'** - Knowledge about food sources can be crucial if we run out of supplies.
10. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets** - These can help replenish electrolytes lost through sweat.
11. **Overcoat (for everyone)** - Although it’s hot now, the temperature can drop at night, making an overcoat useful.
12. **Parachute (red & white)** - While it may seem less critical, it could be used for signaling or creating shade.
13. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)** - While it provides protection, its utility may be limited in this scenario unless we encounter threats.
14. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor** - This could have some uses, but overall its practical value for survival is low.
15. **A cosmetic mirror** - The least critical item; while it can be used for signaling, it's not essential for survival.

What do you all think about this initial order? I'm open to adjustments based on your perspectives!"
"(Turn 2) Morgan has responded: Hi Alex, thanks for sharing your insights! You've made some solid points about prioritizing hydration and protection. I agree that water is paramount, especially in such extreme heat. I have a few thoughts on the order, especially regarding the use of items like the cosmetic mirror and the liquor.

Here’s how I would approach it:

1. **2 litres of water per person** - Absolutely essential for survival.
2. **First-aid kit** - Critical for any potential injuries.
3. **Plastic raincoat (large size)** - Great for sun protection; I think this is a solid choice.
4. **Torch with 4 battery-cells** - Important for navigation and signaling.
5. **Magnetic compass** - Helpful for navigation, though I think it might be less critical than the air map.
6. **Air map of the area** - Provides context for our location, which could be vital for navigation.
7. **Sunglasses (for everyone)** - Protecting our eyes from the sun is definitely a priority.
8. **Folding knife** - Very useful for numerous tasks.
9. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'** - Practical knowledge about food sources can be crucial if we run low on supplies.
10. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets** - Important for hydration and replenishing electrolytes.
11. **Overcoat (for everyone)** - Useful for potential temperature drops at night.
12. **Parachute (red & white)** - Can be used for shade or signaling, I agree it has some utility here.
13. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)** - While it has its uses, the chances of needing it may be low in this environment.
14. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor** - I think this could actually be lower on the list since its practical uses in survival are limited and might even be detrimental.
15. **A cosmetic mirror** - Useful for signaling, but I agree it can be at the bottom of our priorities.

What do you think about moving the air map up in priority and possibly placing the liquor even lower? I'd love to hear your thoughts!"
"(Turn 3) Taylor has responded: Taylor here! Thanks for your thoughtful insights, Alex and Morgan. I appreciate the focus on immediate survival and the practicality of our choices. 

I completely agree that hydration is our top priority, as well as the first-aid kit. Here’s how I feel about some of the items:

1. **2 litres of water per person** - Absolutely essential for survival in this heat.
2. **First-aid kit** - Critical for treating any injuries.
3. **Plastic raincoat (large size)** - Important for sun protection and moisture retention.
4. **Torch with 4 battery-cells** - Essential for navigation and signaling, especially at night.

6. **Magnetic compass** - Useful, but I agree that the air map has more comprehensive utility.
7. **Sunglasses (for everyone)** - Great for protecting our eyes from the harsh sun.
8. **Folding knife** - Versatile tool that can be invaluable for multiple tasks.
9. **A book entitled 'Desert Animals That Can Be Eaten'** - This knowledge could be beneficial if we need to find food.
10. **Bottle of 1000 salt tablets** - Important for electrolyte balance.
11. **Overcoat (for everyone)** - Useful for nighttime temperature drops.
12. **Parachute (red & white)** - Can serve multiple purposes like signaling or shade.
13. **45 calibre pistol (loaded)** - While it offers protection, its necessity in this environment may be limited.
14. **2 litres of 180 proof liquor** - I agree with Morgan that this should be lower on the list. Its negative effects outweigh potential benefits.
15. **A cosmetic mirror** - Least critical; while it can be used for signaling, it doesn't have as much practical utility for survival.

I think we can adjust the list to prioritize the air map over the compass and drop the liquor even lower. What do you both think about this revised ranking? Let's work towards a consensus!"
